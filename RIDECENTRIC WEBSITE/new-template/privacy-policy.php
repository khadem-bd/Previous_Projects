                            <p>Please note that we don't sell your personal information or act as a data broker. However, we may share your information with third parties, service providers, and other users to provide you with personalized ads and to make our platform work. Some of these disclosures may fall under the definition of "sharing" or "selling" of personal information under certain U.S. state privacy laws.

We finally provide the Driver the Rider's rating and comments when the journey is over.

                            Although we facilitate communication between Riders and Drivers to coordinate a pickup, we never disclose your actual phone number or other contact details to other users. If you report a lost or discovered item to us, we will try to put you in touch with the appropriate Rider or Driver. With your permission, we may share their real contact information.</p>
                            <p><span class="mr-1">● </span>  Rides Paid for or Requested by Others- Others may have requested or paid for some of the rides you take. We may share some or all of your ride details with that other party if you take one of those rides using your Business Profile account, a pass code, or coupon, a subsidized program (like transit or the government), a corporate credit card connected to another account, or if another user or entity requests or pays for a ride (or portion of a ride) on your behalf. These details may include your identity (like your name and phone number), the date, time, charge, rating given, region of trip.</p>
