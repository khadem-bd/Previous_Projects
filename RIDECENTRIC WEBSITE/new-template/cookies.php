                        <p>Cookies refer to small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. These files are commonly used by website owners to facilitate the proper functioning of their websites and enhance the reporting capabilities of their sites.</p>
                        <p>First-party cookies are those that are set by the website owner (in this case, RideCentric), whereas third-party cookies are those set by external parties other than the website owner. Third-party cookies may enable external features or functionalities on or through the website, such as advertising, interactive content, or analytics. Parties that set these third-party cookies can identify your computer when it accesses the website or other associated websites.</p>
                        <h5 class="head-font"><strong>Why do we use cookies?</strong></h5>
                        <p>We use both first-party and third-party cookies for a variety of reasons. Some cookies are deemed necessary for the technical operation of our Website, and we classify them as "essential" or "strictly necessary" cookies. Other cookies allow us to track and target the interests of our users to improve their experience on our Online Properties. Third parties may serve cookies through our Website for advertising, analytics, and other purposes, which are explained in greater detail below.</p>
                        <h5 class="head-font"><strong>How can I control cookies?</strong></h5>
                        <p>You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies. You can exercise your cookie preferences through the Cookie Consent Manager, which permits you to select the categories of cookies that you accept or reject. Essential cookies cannot be rejected since they are necessary to provide you with our services.</p>
                        <p>The Cookie Consent Manager is located in the notification banner and on our website. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still access our website, but your ability to utilize certain functions and parts of our website may be limited.

                        <h5 class="head-font"><strong>What about other tracking technologies, like web beacons?</strong></h5>
                        <p>Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors to a website. Other similar technologies, like web beacons (sometimes called "tracking pixels" or "clear gifs"), may also be used from time to time. These are tiny graphic files that contain a unique identifier that enables recognition when someone has visited the website or opened an email containing them. This allows for the monitoring of traffic patterns, delivery or communication of cookies, understanding whether users have come from third-party websites, improving site performance, and measuring the success of email marketing campaigns. In many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly, and declining cookies may impair their functioning.</p>
                        <h5 class="head-font"><strong>Do you use Flash cookies?</strong></h5>
                        <p>Websites may also use "Flash Cookies" (also known as Local Shared Objects or "LSOs") for site operations, fraud prevention, and other purposes. Users can adjust their Flash player settings to block Flash Cookies storage using the tools contained in the Website Storage Settings Panel, or by going to the Global Storage Settings Panel and following the instructions. However, note that setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit acceptance of Flash Cookies may reduce or impede the functionality of some Flash applications.</p>
                        <h5 class="head-font"><strong>Do you serve targeted advertising?</strong></h5>
                        <p>Third parties may serve cookies on users' computers or mobile devices to serve advertising through the website. These companies may use information about visits to this and other websites to provide relevant advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest. They may also use technology to measure the effectiveness of advertisements, using cookies or web beacons to collect information. The information collected through this process does not identify users' name, contact details, or other direct identification unless provided by users.</p>
                        <h5 class="head-font"><strong>How often will you update this Cookie Policy?</strong></h5>
                        <p>The Cookie Policy may be updated from time to time to reflect changes to the cookies used or for operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. Users should revisit the Cookie Policy regularly to stay informed. The date at the top of the Cookie Policy indicates when it was last updated.</p>
                        <p class="mb-0">If users have any questions about the use of cookies or other technologies, they may email info@ridecentric.com or send a post to the provided address. </p>
