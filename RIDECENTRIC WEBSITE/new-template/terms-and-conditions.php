                        gasoline average compiled weekly and published by the Department of Energy. The surcharge will be adjusted when the fuel cost per gallon remains steady at a new level for

                        <p>Minor reservation changes must be made at least 24 hours before the scheduled pickup time. Changes made within 24 hours of the scheduled pickup time will be subject to availability and may incur additional charges.
                        Significantly modifying a reservation inside the cancellation window results in a no-show/full charge and must be rebooked as a new reservation.</p>
                        <p> <strong class="ml-4"> 6.2 Delays and No Shows</strong></p>
                        <p>Suppose you are still on time and miss your scheduled pickup time. In that case, we will accommodate you on the next available ride, subject to availability. However, if you do not show up for your scheduled pickup time, the ride will result in a no-show/full charge and must be rebooked as a new reservation.</p>

                        <p>RideCentric reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to seek an authorization hold for overestimated charges for a ride.<br>
                        During this time, THESE FUNDS MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE FOR USE. A different payment type can be used upon ride completion. If another payment type is used, the card reserving the reservation will be reversed.
                        **Note: The cardholder's bank may take time to post it back to the account.</p>

                        Any issues, concerns, or discrepancies must be addressed in writing within 5 business days of receipt. After this review period, invoice(s) will be considered final. Any amount in question due to a service failure will be credited as we remain in the process of resolving the discrepancy.<br>
                        Cardholder remains obligated to pay any part of the invoice that is not in question.<br>
                        Payments made by credit card will incur an additional 3.5% convenience fee. Other payment methods may be made by ACH / Bank Wire or Check deposits. A credit card must be supplied as a backup or secondary form of payment for ACH and check prices.</p>
