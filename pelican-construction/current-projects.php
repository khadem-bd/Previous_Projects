                    <h2>Adolphus Tower</h2>
                    <p>Our team took on the renovation of a <b><i>historic landmark</i></b> in Downtown Dallas - The Adolphus Tower. Through this redevelopment, we have been able to activate an often-forgotten corner of Main Street.</p>
                    <p>Located in the <b><i>Dallas CBD</i></b> and connected to the historic Adolphus Hotel, the boutique office building has <b><i>integrated</i></b> new <b><i>mechanical systems</i></b>, a <b><i>welcoming office lobby</i></b>, <b><i>optimal conference rooms</i></b>, and many more <b><i>functional amenities</i></b>. The corner of the building will undergo construction to be repurposed for a warm restaurant/cozy coffee shop stop for tenants and Dallas visitors. </p>
                    <p>With Pegasus Plaza across the street and AT&T’s Discovery District a half-block away, Adolphus Tower has <b><i>greatly contributed to the walkability and physicality</i></b> of the intersection of Main and Akard Streets.</p>
