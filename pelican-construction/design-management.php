                    <p>At Loumain we work in a team with top architects, building and fitout designers to deliver award-winning designs for our clients. </p>

                            <h4>Design planning, design brief, building design management</h4>
                            <p>Loumain works closely with many of the top 100 building design architects to assist clients with design. We manage the flow from planning and concept to design briefs and concept drafting  (incorporating a construction design management plan)</p>
                            <p>This service allows our clients to:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Identify potential town planning concerns which need addressing</li>
                                <li>Present a concept design document as part of a development or town planning application</li>
                                <li>Identify preliminary budget estimates for works (including site area works) or engage a quantity surveyor</li>
                                <li>Present a design brief for internal or external collaboration and review</li>

                            </ul>
                            <p>We assist our clients in identifying potential cost savings even in this early conceptual stage. The design deliverable often allows an investor or developer to generate external interest, recruit tenants and other interested parties.</p>
