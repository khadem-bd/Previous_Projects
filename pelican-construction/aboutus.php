                    <h4>Pelican CM Concepts is reputed for its integrity, quality, service,  and attention to detail.</h4>
                    <p>As a woman-owned minority business (certified by the DFW Minority Supplier Development council), our transition from “local builder” to now being among DFW’s most reputed construction companies has been a meaningful one. This growth is a testament to the relations we’ve built and our carefully curated approach of prioritizing client services. </p>
                    <p>Having served more than 15 years in the commercial and residential real estate markets, we take pride in the fact that much of our business is attributed to repeat clients and customer referrals. Regardless of how big or small a project is, here at Pelican CM Concepts, we are determined to create custom, innovative, quality-driven solutions. As believers that quality is more impactful than quantity, we consider customer expectations and do our best to deliver more than what is expected.</p>
                    <p>Our approach is simple. We strive to do more than building promising properties. We create lasting relationships, vibrant landmarks, and deliver exceptional results. </p>
                    <h4>We may work most often with concrete, steel, and glass, but our best work is created with our soft skills – communication, understanding, and pride in the work we do.</h4>
