                      Our approach to family dentistry is chiefly concerned with
                      the overall health and oral well-being of your family’s
                      teeth. We also concentrate on the unique needs of children
                      of all age groups and extend specialty services that
                      address their needs. These services include the following.

                      </div>
                      <p>
                        You and your family must make it a practice to visit
                        your dentist at least once every six months for a
                        comprehensive examination and cleanings. It is the
                        belief of most people that children do not need these
                        frequent visits and cleanings. But in reality, the
                        children need extra care because their baby teeth are
                        more delicate and more prone to develop cavities when
                        compared to adults.

                      <p>
                        Dental restorations help restore the function and
                        overall appearance of a damaged tooth. They can be made
                        from different materials, including porcelain, gold,
                        silver, and plastic. Dental restorations such as
                        fillings, crowns, dental implants, and dentures can
                        solve multiple problems such as damaged, chipped, broken
                        teeth, and missing teeth.

                      <p>
                        Dental X-rays enable us to evaluate your oral health
                        systematically. These X-rays are used with low radiation
                        levels to capture images of the insides of your gums and
                        teeth. This could help us to detect problems like
                        cavities, tooth decay, and impacted teeth.

                      <p>
                        Sealants offer a simple method to prevent children from
                        developing cavities. They are composed of a thin resin
                        that ensures protection for the teeth from decay.
                        Sealants are a preventive measure and can help save a
                        great deal of money on dental procedures in the long
                        run.

                      <p>
                        As dentists, our main aim is to save your natural teeth
                        and keep them healthy for as long as possible. However,
                        there are times when a tooth extraction becomes a
                        necessity. This could be due to various reasons — a
                        tooth has incurred severe damage due to trauma or decay,
                        an impacted wisdom tooth, or overcrowding of the teeth.

                      <p>
                        Root canal treatment is a rather straightforward
                        procedure to give you relief from dental pain and save
                        your teeth. The center of a tooth has a pulp chamber,
                        and when it develops a severe infection, it has to be
                        treated immediately to save the tooth.
