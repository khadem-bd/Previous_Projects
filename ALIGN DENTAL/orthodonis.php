                      patient with the most effective orthodontics for their
                      needs. Before starting the orthodontic treatment, our
                      dental professionals will perform a thorough examination
                      of the patientâ€™s bite, jaw alignment, and any protruding
                      teeth, among other issues, to determine the best course of
                      treatment.

                      <p>
                        Orthodontics is the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment
                        of abnormalities in the teeth and jaws, including the
                        alignment and placement of teeth with braces. Treatment
                        through orthodontics has progressed over time, both in
                        terms of flexibility and availability of different
                        options. In addition, modern orthodontic appliances have
                        been created to offer a more discreet and comfortable
                        experience than orthodontics in years past.

                      <p>
                        We offer many orthodontic treatments to help our
                        patients achieve their healthiest and most perfect
                        smiles. Our treatments include traditional metal braces,
                        invisible ceramic braces, and clear orthodontic aligners
                        designed to meet your dental goals. While clear aligners
                        are an excellent orthodontic treatment choice for many
                        patients, traditional brackets may help other patients
                        achieve their desired results better. Contact us at One
                        Health Dental and we will provide you with more
                        information about the types of dental services and
                        procedures we offer.

                      </div>
                      <p>
                        Traditional metal braces are what most people imagine
                        when they think of orthodontic treatment. These braces
                        are made from high-quality stainless steel and are fixed
                        to the front portion of each tooth with medical-grade
                        dental cement. The brackets are connected by an archwire
                        consisting of a thin metal wire. This wire adjusts and
                        aligns the teeth with gentle pressure and shifts the
                        teeth to the desired positions throughout treatment.

                        <h3>Invisible Ceramic Braces</h3>
                      </div>
                      <p>
                        Ceramic braces are a widely preferred choice among teens
                        and adults who seek a more discreet form of orthodontia
                        during treatment. Commonly referred to as clear braces,
                        these invisible braces function similarly to traditional
                        braces. The difference is the brackets are fabricated
                        from ceramic and blend in effortlessly with the shade of
                        natural teeth. A metal wire, which is suitably adjusted
                        throughout treatment, holds the brackets together to
                        align the teeth.

                        <h3>Clear Orthodontic Aligners</h3>
                      </div>
                      <p>
                        Clear orthodontic aligners comprise a series of clear,
                        removable trays secured over the teeth to align them.
                        They are worn for up to 20 to 22 hours a day, and the
                        treatment may take anywhere between 6 to 18 months to
                        rectify the orthodontic irregularities. One of the
                        significant advantages of clear orthodontic aligners is
                        that patients can remove the aligners to brush and floss
                        their teeth. Additionally, any discomfort to the wearer
                        is considerably reduced.
