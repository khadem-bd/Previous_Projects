                    <h1>What Are Dental Implants?</h1>
                    <p>
                      Dental implants are replacement tooth roots that closely
                      resemble natural teeth and offer a strong foundation for
                      restoration teeth. Implants restore the teeth's
                      functionality and help them to chew and bite like they
                      used to do. Besides, implants also support the jawbone's
                      integrity and prevent additional bone loss.
                    </p>

                      <p>
                        Dental implants are surgically inserted titanium posts
                        placed beneath the gum line and crowned with an
                        artificial replacement tooth. The implants are
                        fabricated from titanium, a biocompatible material
                        capable of grafting with human bone. At One Health
                        Dental, we offer dental implant services and are
                        committed to providing our patients with the care and
                        support they need throughout the whole process.

                        <h3>The Benefits of Dental Implants</h3>
                      </div>
                      <p>
                        There are considerable benefits to getting dental
                        implants, but the most amazing benefit is that the
                        implant preserves the integrity of the jawbone. So, in
                        addition to filling the gaps created by the missing
                        teeth, implants help prevent other potentially risky
                        problems from emerging in the future.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Dental implants also efficiently upgrade your dentures.
                        If you presently have removable dentures, dental
                        implants allow you to permanently secure your dentures
                        to your gums.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        From an aesthetic viewpoint, dental implants also
                        enhance your overall appearance and could restore a
                        sense of self-confidence. On the other hand, if you
                        donâ€™t have your missing teeth replaced, the shape of
                        your face and jaw would be affected. Hence, the simple
                        act of replacing even one tooth can have an incredible
                        impact on your quality of life.

                        <h3>Implant Process</h3>
                      </div>
                      <p>
                        Dental implants usually need several visits to the
                        dental office and most likely a few months to fully
                        accomplish. During your initial consultation, if your
                        dentist determines that dental implants are your best
                        option, they will examine the jawbone to determine where
                        an implant may be inserted and ensure that a tooth
                        implant is a viable alternative. During this part of the
                        treatment, the dentist will generally need to take
                        X-rays or other imaging forms.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        After it has been decided that you are a good fit for
                        the procedure, the dentist will surgically insert a
                        titanium screw into your jawbone. After this process has
                        been accomplished, your bone will need some time to heal
                        and finish fusing itself to the titanium screw. This
                        stage of the process will be different for each patient
                        but will ideally take up to a few months.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Once the bone has healed and the grafting process is
                        complete, an abutment will be placed. This abutment
                        securely holds the crown, which will then be cemented
                        using either a specialty screw or dental cement. Once
                        this part of the procedure is complete, your new tooth
                        will finally be in place, and the procedure will have
                        concluded.
