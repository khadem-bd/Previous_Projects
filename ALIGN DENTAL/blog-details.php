                      Good oral health is essential to your overall well-being.
                      Just like the rest of your body your mouth needs nutrients
                      to stay healthy. However, certain bad habits can harm your
                      teeth. Here are some of them.
                    </p>

                    <div class="sub-section">
                      <div class="sub-title">
                        <img src="assets/img/text/s.png" alt="" />
                        <h3>moking</h3>

                      <p>
                        Tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable disease
                        and death among Americans. Besides causing cancer in the
                        mouth and lungs, cigarettes also damage gums and teeth.
                        People who smoke have an increased risk of tooth decay
                        because tobacco reduces blood flow to the gum tissue and
                        decreases the body’s ability to fight bacteria. As a
                        result, smokers are more likely to experience gum
                        disease and lose their teeth early. Cigarettes also
                        stain teeth and cause bad breath. If you have the habit
                        of smoking, quit them at the earliest, for good.

                        <h3>eeth grinding</h3>
                      </div>
                      <p>
                        Bruxism is a common habit that damages your teeth and
                        affects your quality of life. Grinding your teeth can
                        lead to chipped or broken teeth, tooth sensitivity
                        issues, jaw pain or discomfort, and other issues. If you
                        grind your teeth, talk to your dentist about possible
                        solutions. Many patients benefit from a custom
                        mouthguard or night guard. A custom appliance fits
                        comfortably over your teeth and prevents the effect of
                        clenching or grinding. Your dentist can also show you
                        some relaxation techniques that can help you stop
                        grinding your teeth in your sleep.

                        <h3>hewing on ice</h3>
                      </div>
                      <p>
                        Chewing on ice can lead to tooth fractures and chipped
                        enamel. Your teeth are strong, but they’re not made to
                        withstand too much pressure. If you chew on hard
                        objects, like ice or hard candy, it can wear down the
                        outer layer of your teeth, called enamel. Enamel is the
                        first line of defense against tooth decay. Once it’s
                        gone, you risk developing cavities and infections.
                        Besides hitting your enamel, ice can chip fillings or
                        crowns. It’s best to avoid these types of chewy treats
                        altogether. If you do crack a tooth, see your dentist as
                        soon as possible to patch it up and prevent further
                        damage.

                      <p>
                        Nail biting is a pretty common habit, but it can cause
                        tooth sensitivity, enamel damage, and even tooth loss.

                        own, talk to us about possible solutions. We can work
                        with you to break bad habits for good!

                      <p>
                        Some people use their teeth as tools - to open packages,
                        tear something, etc. Engaging in any activity that puts
                        your teeth at risk of damage can result in cavities,
                        broken teeth, or the need for restorative dentistry
                        treatment like dental crowns or even a root canal.
