                        <h2>Investment Strategy</h2>
                        <h3>We take on the most challenging projects with calculated risks in order to make the greatest possible social impact.</h3>
                        <p>At its core, our investment strategy is to pursue opportunities that have the potential to make a positive impact on people and places. Whether it is opening restaurants on a struggling downtown corner, creating jobs in underinvested communities, or giving young entrepreneurs the boost they need to launch a dream - our philosophy is to foster and pursue impact opportunities. </p>
                        <p>We invest in projects and businesses that may seem overly complex to the common eye. What sets us apart is that we take the time to completely immerse ourselves in the social, cultural, and economic context of the situation. We carefully analyze risk and reward to ensure we set ourselves, our partners, and our communities up for success.</p>
